the manifesto comes in two form.

the twelve manifesto items

four thing that are preferred over this kind of stuff.

agile is named that way to be flexible to things around.
to be nimble. to be able to change to things around you.

4 more main motivations for agile

death marches-death marches are not pretty.

1. indiviuals interactions over processes

2. working software over completed docs

3. customer collaboration over contract negotiation
big bang-work at what user want. come up with a cost 
estimate. 

4. flexible to change over follow the plan.

you're talking with the customers all the time.
talking amongst the developers all the time.

agile manifesto-better half

1. satisfy the customer through early and continous delivery

2. accept changing requirements at all times

3. deliver evolving products every 2 to 8 weeks

7. measure progress in working software features

10. simplicity is better than quantity in code

11. let the team self-organize

agile-stanup
-start of day
-stand at the program board
-15 minutes or less
-everyone answers 3 questions
1. what was completed yesterday
2. what plan to complete today
3. any obstacles?

within a team it's important to let everyone know what's going on.

prototyping
special techinical 
new api
new algortihm
not to show user
2. mfs
build a prototype with a minimum feature set so that you can
show more stuff.
-black box. user doesn't get a feel for how it is working
-main scenario only
-minimum viable product: smallest thing they can build to
see if the user will want

get a copy of all the files 
the manifest describes the file and the relative path to the file

each team member interface with each other and themselves.

write program that copies files from one place to another.

Assume cmd line was this:
C:> myvcs create c:/projs/mypt c:/repo/p1
